  <div class="description">
    <p>Hey! My name’s Amy. I am a freelance web designer based in Athens, Georgia. I have been living in Athens, Georgia the school year started. I transferred from Kennesaw State University and I have been enjoying UGA so far. UGA is such a large and loud campus! I started doing web design ever since summer of 2017 and I learned about basic HTML and CSS during my summer break. I am passionate about design and illustration and I want to help you make your next project be beautiful. Having a website doesn't have to be expensive, and I believe that every business deserves a good looking website. I am very flexible when it comes to making changes to your website and there are unlimited revises available. (Well, not a million times.) I believe that I will deliver the most satisfying web project ever and you won't leave without a smile and you would come back again. 
      <br><br>
      I am from Fuzhou, Fujian, China and I moved to the United States in 2007. I have lived in Georgia for 10 years. I have two siblings named Iliana and Bryan. My family lives in Leon, Mexico, I visit them almost every other year. I am a junior and currently studying Web Developement in University of Georgia. I love eating noodles and I love celebrating the dragon festival. China and the United States are very different. The biggest thing about each is its people of the country. People in China are very strict about everything while people in America are more laid back. The second biggest thing is the food. Chinese people eat rice or noodles everyday and they rarely eat lots of fat since having no fat is a standard of beauty in China. 
      <br><br>
      I have worked as a freelancer multiple times, worked as a designer for HVAC interface systems, worked retail at Jo-ann fabrics, made 8 costumes (for myself, thank you very much, and the number continues growing) and been a professional superhero. When I’m not doing web design you can find me always on my laptop, watch TV, writing, reading, or hanging out with my dog and other people's dogs. My favorite kind of dog is a basset hound and an Australian hound mix, they are the cutest dogs ever because they are my dog. Their names are Gracie and Mac. It would have been nice if I named Gracie "Cheese" instead of Gracie. These two breeds are completely opposite of each other. One is bossy, one is submissive. One is hyper, one is always sleeping, one barks all the time and the other barely makes a sound.  </p>

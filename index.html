  <div class="description">
    <p>Hey! My name’s Amy. I am a freelance web designer based in Athens, Georgia. I started to have an interest in web design ever since summer of 2017 and I started to learn about basic HTML and CSS during my summer break. I am passionate about design and illustration and I want to help you make your next project be beautiful.
      <br><br>
      I am from Fuzhou, Fujian, China and I moved to the United States in 2007. I have lived in Georgia for 10 years. I have two siblings named Iliana and Bryan. My family lives in Leon, Mexico, I visit them almost every other year. I am a junior and currently studying Web Developement in University of Georgia.
      <br><br>
      I have worked as a freelancer multiple times, worked as a designer for HVAC interface systems, worked retail at Jo-ann fabrics, made 8 costumes (for myself, thank you very much, and the number continues growing) and been a professional superhero. When I’m not doing web design you can find me always on my laptop, watch TV, playing video games, writing, reading, or hanging out with my dog and other people's dogs.</p>

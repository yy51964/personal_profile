  <h3>Web Design</h3>
  <p>This is am example description. I graduated from University of Georgia, Georgia with a B.S in Web Design. Since then I have worked as a freelancer multiple times, worked as a designer for HVAC interface systems, worked retail at Jo-ann fabrics, made 8 costumes (for myself, thank you very much, and the number continues growing) and been a professional superhero. When I’m not doing art you can find me sewing costumes, playing video games, watching anime, writing, reading, or hanging out with my dog and other people's dogs.
